# Manual GitHub Pages Deployment

## Step 1: Build the Project
```bash
npm run build
```

## Step 2: Manual Upload (Since billing blocks gh-pages)

### Method 1: Direct Branch Upload
1. Create a new branch called `gh-pages` in your repo
2. Delete all files in `gh-pages` branch
3. Upload ALL contents from your `build` folder to the root of `gh-pages` branch
4. Go to Settings → Pages → Source: gh-pages branch

### Method 2: Use Netlify (Recommended)
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Drag & drop your `build` folder
3. Get instant URL like: `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Method 3: Use Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Import your GitHub repo
3. Auto-deploys to: `https://bellavista-react-converted.vercel.app`

## Your Current URLs Should Be:
- **GitHub Pages**: https://anwin-wilson.github.io/bellavista-react-converted
- **Netlify**: After drag-drop upload
- **Vercel**: After repo import

## Test Your Deployment:
1. Visit the URL
2. Navigate to different pages
3. Test login: admin@bellavista.com / 1234
4. Test logout functionality

All navigation will work with HashRouter!
